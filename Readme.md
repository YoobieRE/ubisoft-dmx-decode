## How to capture requests from Ubisoft Connect

### 1. Keydumping Setup

1. Prerequesites:
   - Windows 10 or Windows 11
   - Python 3.9 (I used pyenv)
   - Wireshark
1. If you're on Windows 11: ([source](https://github.com/ngo/win-frida-scripts/issues/2))
   - Search for "Exploit protection" and open
   - Click "Program settings"
   - Click "Add program to customize"
   - Click "Add program by name"
   - Enter `lsass.exe` and continue
   - Scroll to "Hardware-enforced Stack Protection", turn it **Off**, and click Apply
   - Restart your computer
1. Install [frida](https://github.com/frida/frida#1-install-from-prebuilt-binaries) and ensure it works

    ```ps
    > pip install frida-tools
    > frida --version
    15.1.15
    ```

1. Save [`keylog.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngo/win-frida-scripts/master/lsasslkeylog-easy/keylog.js) somewhere you'll remember

### 2. Capturing Keys

1. Close Ubisoft Connect
1. Search for "Windows PowerShell", right-click it and **Run as administrator**
1. Start capturing keys with

    ```ps
    frida --no-pause lsass.exe -l \path\to\keylog.js
    ```

   - If frida can't find `lsass.exe`, get its process ID from the Task Manager Details tab, or by running `Get-Process -Name lsass` and use that instead of `lsass.exe` in the `frida` command

1. You should see `C:\keylog.log` beginning to populate. Keep `frida` running until you're done capturing packets

### 3. Capturing Packets

1. Open Wireshark
1. Go to Edit > Preferences > Protocols > TLS > (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename > Browse... > navigate to `C:\keylog.log`, then click OK
1. View > Name Resolution > Check "Resolve Network Addresses"
1. Click your adapter in the "Capture" list to begin capturing (I use "Ethernet")
1. Open Ubisoft Connect and do some things
1. Click the ðŸŸ¥ button to stop capture
1. In the filter bar, enter `(ip.dst_host == dmx.upc.ubisoft.com) || (ip.src_host == dmx.upc.ubisoft.com)`
1. Press CTRL+R to reload the packets to ensure decryption applies
1. Right click a TLSv1.2 packet > Follow > TLS Stream, a window containing some readable text should appear. This means the decryption is working.
1. Set "Show data as" to `YAML`, click "Save as...", and save as `tls-stream.yml`.
1. Once saved, click the "Filter out this stream" button. Typically there are multiple demux TLS streams in one capture, and you'll need to repeat the above step for each one. Keep saving and filtering until none remain.

### 4. Decoding the requests

1. Clone this project
1. `npm i`
1. Move `tls-stream.yml` to the root of the project
1. `npm start`. The output will be written to `decodes.json`

## How to get the .proto's

Only needed if you need to update the protos

1. [Follow steps 1-3 of this guide](https://github.com/claabs/uplay-install-reverse#protobuf-schema).
1. Copy the `upc_protos` folder here and rename it to `proto`
